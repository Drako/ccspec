# CCSpec

```c++
describe("CCSpec", [] {
```

CCSpec is a BDD-style testing framework for C++, specifially, C++11. You write
tests (or specs in CCSpec context) using a semi-natural language that is
perfectly valid C++ code, effectively making your specs executable
documentation.

CCSpec is derived from RSpec, the BDD testing framework for Ruby. In fact,
CCSpec is simply an attempt to port RSpec from Ruby to C++ as much as possible.

```c++
